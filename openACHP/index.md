# openACHP

openACHP is a library for optimizing heat-driven cooling system
designs. It includes some simple cycle and heat exchange models for
realistic results. Applications include selection of a cooling system
and education.

## To-DO ...

* Optimization problem statement
* Cooling cycle models
* Heat exchange models
* System models
* Optimizers
* Fluid properties
* Results

## Set-up for using the library

Use the environment file to install with conda. See documentation for
help installing CoolProp in Windows. Some additional packages may be
useful but are not used by the code:

- pandas
- beautifulsoup4
- pandoc
- TeX environment for nbconvert (see [here](http://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html))
